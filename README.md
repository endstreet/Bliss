Blissed Out

This project has dependencies on hardware and specifically to a Bluetooth device.
The bluetooth device is a 50' Catamaran with motors, compass, gps and a horde of other devices.

When you start the application and the hardware is not detected the software will enter a simulation mode.

Startup project is Bliss.csproj. It is a windows app.

Pre-requisites for Simulation mode:

A joystick is required for Simulation mode. The "View" thub control will provide Forward(speed-up),Backward(speed-down), Left and Right control.

Feel free to  contact me for any required info.
